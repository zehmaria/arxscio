### Synopsis

Reborn without a great destiny, Ben Higgs  despised the fact he was going to run out of time. 

In front of him a path of fantasy was laid, but his body lacked the talent.

There were legends of immortality, but everything was out of reach.

Ben grew old and alone. Confronting death, he gave up everything to stay alive. 

‘Conquering the world? Power and immortality? Those may be impossible, but I must keep my poor little life!’

He wanted to see what it took to be fated for greatness. He wanted to discover the truths. He didn’t want to be an ant forever! He wanted know! 

‘What? How? Why?’

Even if he gets himself destroyed and lost forever in this absolute madness, he must at least taste the taboos from the Heavens!
